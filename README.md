This repository contains web scraping codes and data analysis codes used for our project "Harvesting and Analyzing the Library Course Reserve Entries at City University and CUHK —— In Terms of Communication and Sociology."
## Data Collection
First we scraped the information of the books from the website of library of CUHK and City University. We show the codes in the files named "URLs of cityu_communication with sociology", "cityu scrape" and "cuhk scrape".
## Data Processing
Then we analyzed the raw data and visualized the results. We show the codes in the files named "same books 1", "same books2", "year count & cleaning & order & graphic" and "keywords in the book titles". The two png files and one otf files are used for the visualization of the results in "keywords in the book titles".
